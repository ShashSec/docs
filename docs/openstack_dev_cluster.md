There are many ways to deploy openstack, and many different instructions available.

The [Devstack multi-node lab](http://devstack.org/guides/multinode-lab.html) guide seems to be the simplest for a small simple deployment like this.

Another benefit of this instalation guide is that it is based on the same scripts as the [one-node openstack deployment](./docs/openstack_dev_single.md) - so any Docker-specific modifications or other changes described there should apply here as well.
